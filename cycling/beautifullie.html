		<h2 class="title">Indoor training - Just a beautiful lie</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Indoor cycling training has become increasingly popular in recent years, with platforms like Zwift or Roovy providing a virtual environment for riders to train in. While indoor cycling may seem like a convenient and effective way to train, it's important to recognize that it can also be a "beautiful lie." In this post, I'll explore some of the key reasons why outdoor training may provide better quality training compared to indoor training and some of the reasons why indoor cycling training may not be as beneficial as it appears.</p>
			<h3>Real-world conditions</h3>
            <p>One of the primary benefits of outdoor training is that it exposes me to real-world conditions that can't be replicated on indoors platforms. Wind, rain, hills, and road conditions all play a role in outdoor cycling, and learning to navigate these challenges can help to become a more skilled and adaptable cyclist. Additionally, outdoor training can help to develop better bike handling skills and improve the balance and coordination. Training indoors may provide a convenient and consistent workout, but it doesn't prepare a cyclist for the real world.</p>
			<h3>Lack of resistance training</h3>
			<p>When I'm cycling outside, I'm mostly required to work against resistance, such as gravity and wind. This kind of resistance training can help build my strength and power in ways that indoor training simply can't replicate. Additionally, outdoor training can provide a more varied and challenging workout, as I encounter different types of terrain and road conditions. Indoor cycling, on the other hand, doesn't provide the same kind of resistance training and may not be as effective at building strength.</p>
			<h3>Mental stimulation</h3>
			<p>Cycling outside requires a different kind of mental engagement than indoor cycling. When I'm outside, I need to pay attention to my surroundings, dogs, cars, navigate different terrain, and make split-second decisions based on traffic or road conditions. This kind of mental stimulation can be stimulating and rewarding, and it can help to develop better focus and concentration. Cycling indoors for extended periods of time can be mentally draining. Riding in a stationary position, staring at a screen, and pedaling without the distraction of changing scenery can become monotonous and lead to mental fatigue. Cycling outside provides a more varied and engaging experience that can help to be mentally stimulated and motivated.</p>
			<h3>Fresh air and sunshine</h3>
			<p>Training outside allows me to connect with nature, enjoy the fresh air, the sunshine or sunset. Cycling outdoors can be a refreshing and invigorating experience, and it always reduce my stress and improve my mental well-being.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Indoor training remains in my opinion, just an alternative for cycling training, a surrogate, an alternative that can't replicate the many benefits of outdoor training. From real-world conditions and resistance training to mental stimulation, fresh air, outdoor training offers a more comprehensive and rewarding cycling experience. In conclusion, indoor cycling training may offer a convenient and consistent workout, but it can also be a "beautiful lie."</p>
